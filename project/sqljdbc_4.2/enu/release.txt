CHANGE LIST
-----------
Changes from 4.2.8112.100 to 4.2.8112.200

Change in compiler to mitigate vulnerabilities related to Spectre and Meltdown.

-----------------------------------------
Changes from 4.2.6225.100 to 4.2.8112.100

Fixed issue where LOGIN7 packet did not contain the drivers version number.

Fixed an issue in sqljdbc_xa.dll where transactions may cause handle leak to occur in SQL Server.

------------------------
Changes from 4.1 to 4.2:

The JDBC driver now supports Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 and includes a new jar file, 
sqljdbc42.jar, that is compliant with the JDBC 4.2 API.

The sqljdbc41.jar has been upgraded to be compliant with the JDBC 4.1 API.

Enhanced control of timeout settings for rolling back XA transactions

Updated how an SSL certificate is validated when redirection occurs in Azure

Added a serverSpn connection property to allow flexibility in specifying Kerberos principals (and 
allow cross-realm connections when the client's default realm is not the same as the server).

New Feature: Bulk Copy - Application developers can now write code solutions in Java to quickly 
bulk copy large amounts of data into SQL Server from any data source that can be read with a 
ResultSet instance or from a CSV file.



------------
KNOWN ISSUES
------------
The following are known issues with the Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.2 for SQL Server:

1) PARAMETER METADATA LIMITATIONS WITH THE SQL MERGE STATEMENT

PreparedStatement.getParameterMetadata() throws an SQLException when used
with a parameterized MERGE query.


2) JavaKerberos and IBM VMs

If you are running under Windows environments you may have to specify the principalname in the 
configuration file to get the Java Kerberos working. For example: 
SQLJDBCDriver {
  com.ibm.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  seDefaultCcache=true
  credsType=initiator
  principal=principalname@principaldomain;
};


3) CONNECTION DROPPING WITH SQL AZURE

When connecting to SQL Azure, idle connections may be terminated by a network component (such as a 
firewall) after a period of inactivity. To avoid dropping idle connections by a network component, 
the following registry settings (or their non-Windows equivalents) should be set on the operating 
system where the driver is loaded:
           
Registry Setting                                                                   Recommended value
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveTime            30000
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveInterval         1000
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\TcpMaxDataRetransmission  10
